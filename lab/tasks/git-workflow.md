# `Git workflow` for tasks

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure is based on the [`GitHub flow`](../appendix/github.md#github-flow).

```text
Issue ➜ Branch ➜ Commits ➜ PR ➜ Review ➜ Merge
```

The following diagram shows this workflow in the context of repositories:

## Create a `Lab Task` issue

[Create an issue](../appendix/github.md#create-an-issue) using the `Lab Task` [issue form](../appendix/github.md#issue-form).

## Switch to the `main` branch

[Switch to the `main` branch](../appendix/git-vscode.md#switch-to-the-branch-name-branch) in `VS Code`.

## Detect conflicts

[Detect conflicts with the `origin/main`](../appendix/git-vscode.md#detect-conflicts).

## Pull changes from `origin/main`

[Pull changes from the `main` branch in your fork on `GitHub`](../appendix/git-vscode.md#pull-changes-from-originbranch-name).

## Pull changes from `origin/main` and rebase

You may see errors and messages about conflicts after pulling.

Rebasing places your local commits on top of the commits from `origin/main`. Conflicts occur when commits from `origin/main` modified the same lines in the same files as your local commits.

Complete the following steps:

1. [Pull and rebase from `origin/main`](../appendix/git-vscode.md#pull-and-rebase-from-originbranch-name).
2. If conflicts occur, [resolve them](../appendix/git-vscode.md#resolve-a-merge-conflict).

## Switch to a new branch

[Create a new branch and switch to it](../appendix/git-vscode.md#switch-to-a-new-branch).

### `<task-branch-name>`

We'll refer to the new branch as `<task-branch-name>`.

## Edit files

[Edit files](../appendix/vs-code.md#editor) using `VS Code` to produce changes.

## Commit

[Commit changes](../appendix/git-vscode.md#commit-changes) to the [`<task-branch-name>`](#task-branch-name) to complete the task.

## (Optional) Undo commits

[Undo commits](../appendix/git-vscode.md#undo-commits) if necessary.

## Publish the branch

[Publish the branch](../appendix/git-vscode.md#publish-the-branch) with your changes.

## Push more commits

[Push more commits](../appendix/git-vscode.md#push-more-commits) to the published branch if necessary.

## Create a PR to the `main` branch in your fork

[Create a PR](../appendix/github.md#create-a-pull-request) from the branch [`<task-branch-name>`](#task-branch-name) to the branch `<main>`.
Placeholder values:

- `<repo-name>` is `se-toolkit-lab-3`.
- `<branch-name>` is `<task-branch-name>`.
- [`<repo-owner-github-username>`] is `inno-se-toolkit`.
- [`<your-github-username>`](../appendix/github.md#your-github-username) is your `GitHub` username.

## Get a PR review

[Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review#requesting-reviews-from-collaborators-and-organization-members) a review of the PR from the collaborator (see [PR review rules](#pr-review-rules)).

Get the collaborator's comments and address them, e.g., make fixes or ask to clarify the comment.

Get the collaborator to approve the PR.
